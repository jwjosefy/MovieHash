# MovieHash
CLI utility to seek subtitles SRT in OpenSubtitles site based on the movie hash.

### Why?
Because I'm tired of wrestling with http://legendas.tv and other sites seeking my favourite shows subtitles =)

### Because???
After wandering a lot over the webs, I've found the algorithm which generates movie hashes for downloaded files (AVI, MKV, MP4 etc.)

Here: [HashSourceCodes from OpenSubtitles](http://trac.opensubtitles.org/projects/opensubtitles/wiki/HashSourceCodes)

Note please, the original hashing algorithm is already opensource.

### How to use:
Compile it and use as a command line tool. That's all!

**Sugestion:** 
Copy the binary into some folder on your path (eg.: C:\Windows) **AND / OR** create a link to the EXE into your *Send To* folder.

**Tip:** Type `shell:sendto` into `Win + R` to quickly access Send To folder.
